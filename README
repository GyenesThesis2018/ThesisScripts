This repository contains all the scripts used for the thesis 'Natural Diversity of Caenorhabditis elegans Satiety
Quiescence Behaviour' by the author Bertalan Gyenes. An updated version is forthcoming for our paper that is currently 
in preparation.

The analysis uses the highly comparative time-series analysis software (https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa, commit 6526cdb).
Practically all scripts need to be run in this particular hctsa environment.

The files in the folder 'cluster' were used to parallelise the computation of features for each time series and as such, 
these were run in an hctsa environment on a cluster.

With any questions, please contact: bg814@lms.mrc.ac.uk.
